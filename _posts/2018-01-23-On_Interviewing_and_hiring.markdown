## Background
Due to unforeseen circumstances at my previous company, I started actively looking for work again a couple of months ago. After taking a few weeks off to try to organize myself and get my head straight, I started applying for jobs. After numerous interviews and a brief stint as a contractor I landed at the [University of Wisconsin](http://www.wisc.edu) supporting researchers at the [Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center](http:://www.glbrc.org). As a lead developer, it became my job to find some developers to fit our needs at the center. This switch has given me insight into how broken both sides of the interviewing system are. 

## Why Interviewing Sucks as a Candidate
* **Applying is a pain** - The number of companies which required me to upload a resume, then spend an hour filling out every piece of information from my resume in a 20 part web form is ridiculous. Repeating this process over and over again is defeating. 
* **Recruiters** - Putting your information out there on Dice / Monster / LinkedIn / whatever other sites you feel appropriate is awful. I get daily calls asking me if I'd be interested in moving across the country to work on a three month contract working in wordpress for $12 an hour. I get email after email of recruiters that have obviously never read my resume sending me jobs I have no interest in or am nowhere nearly qualified for. Do yourself a favor and create a google voice number and new email for the job hunt that you can abandon afterwards. You can share your normal contact information with anyone you feel is worth keeping in contact with, I'm sure they won't be offended as they've probably experienced the same thing. 
* **Getting through HR is hard.** - I've seen job descriptions requiring 6 years of HTML 5 experience (released late 2014). I've gotten math quiz questions that were unsolvable. I can't count the number of times somebody thought Java and JavaScript were the same thing. It all boils down to non-technical people given a list of attributes being looked for and not having the common experience or even language to have the flexibility needed to filter good candidates from bad. 

  That doesn't stop them from filtering. It reminds me of this [classic post](http://www.jasonbock.net/jb/News/Item/7c334037d1a9437d9fa6506e2f35eaac)
* **Having the specific combination of experience expected is often impossible** - The requirements for many positions posted are ridiculous and should be regarded more as a wishlist than requirements, but the people involved are often choosing beggars looking for someone who is an expert at all flavors of JavaScript while also being an expert in System Ops and Ruby / Python / etc. I've had people suggest that I couldn't learn .net because I was a Ruby programmer. The truth is that the ability to learn new things and adapt to whatever is required is infinitely superior, but much harder to grasp from a resume. 
* **Interviewing is time consuming** - At this point, most companies I interviewed with had a multi-stepped interview barrage that seemed to be designed to eat up all of your time and happiness to browbeat you into giving up your search. Starting with a time consuming web application, fighting your way through HR and ignoring the impossible requirement posted, you land a phone interview with an HR person. Then another phone interview with a developer. Then a video call. Then an in person interview or two. 
  Add in a couple coding exercises, in languages you've never used and with a time limit on when they're due. The time limit doesn't take into account your time spent watching the baby, dealing with a death in the family, other interviews, or any other number of more important things in your life than dropping a days worth of work on the hopes of it leading to a job interview and that the position is actually something you want to do. 
  
  The in-person interviews range from a couple of hours to an entire day. There are a flurry of people in and out while you sit there answering the same questions and contemplating how long it will be until you can take a break and use the restroom. 
* **Interviewing is intimidating** - Having a group of strangers sit in a last supper format staring you down while pounding you with questions feels like you're the subject of a Congressional Investigation. Add in the fact that you've worked a remote job for the last four years without talking to anybody in a professional setting like this and it's unsettling. There is also the inherent need to land a job piling extra pressure on you to perform. As I'm sure many feel, socialization and public speaking aren't the most natural skills for developers and the interview process is daunting. 
* **It's hard to compete** - There is stiff competition out there for many positions, especially nationally posted remote positions. You're competing with people from around the country for the chance to work remote. Those impossible requirements mentioned above? They had five people that blew those out of the water interview before you so good luck selling yourself. 
* **It's hard to get what you're worth** - Companies use any weakness they can find as an excuse to lowball you on an offer. Sometimes it's hard to stand up for yourself and demand what you're worth when you're stressed about finding work and defeated by the whole process. 
* **Interviewing costs money** - When unemployed, you start thinking about where every dollar is going and things like gas, parking, and dress clothes start to add up. 
* **It's hard to sell yourself** - Nearly every good developer I know fights impostor syndrome constantly. Whether it is in a small office or on a global scale, it's hard not to see the incredible things other people are doing and compare to the misplaced semicolon you spent a day debugging. It's easy to see accomplishments in others and harder in yourself, and the reverse is true of shortcomings. This results in making selling yourself feeling like a lie. 
* **You may just not connect** - I had an interview where the company liked my resume and experience, liked me, but said I "wasn't enthusiastic about working for them." This was a misread on their part, as at the time it was a job I had talked about with my family and friends about how I hoped to land it. Sometimes the interviewer just misreads the candidate or the candidate doesn't convey their skills or attitude well enough and it results in a missed connection. 
* **Sometimes it all comes down to luck** - It's been suggested that researchers rate later candidates lower than ones interviewed earlier in the day. People judge harshly when hungry, thirsty, or needing a bathroom break. Maybe the interview you scheduled a week ago coincided with a production issue popping up that pulled the guy out of the room you had the best chance of connecting with and turning to your side. There is a lot of random luck in making a good impression and being competitive for a position. 

### Summary
Interviewing is time consuming, depressing, and largely fruitless, until it's not.
