# Accessibility Testing in an Agile Development Workflow

Accessibility is an important aspect of web development. Inclusive design and development is essential in modern development practices to ensure all users can access your site content and functionality. Often accessibility is an afterthought if even considered in the development process at all which can cause significant barriers for users accessing digital content. 

## The Traditional Model

The traditional approach to accessibility testing follows 3 main phases.

1. Scoping and Groundwork
2. Testing and Reporting
3. Delivery

## Integrating Accessibility in the Agile Process

An accessibility expert (or at the very least an accessibility minded individual) should be available to the team, or possibly be a team member. They should have input to the product owner to voice concerns and priorities of accessibility changes. 

Passing accessibility testing should be included in your team's definition of done. It should be as important as having test coverage and approval by the product owner. 

Incorporating this into a definition of done keeps it on the forefront of the dev team's mind. It forces devs to develop with accessibility in mind and will result in the normalization of accessible software as the team learns that tickets aren't complete without being accessible. 

## Logistics

Having access to a continuous integration environment for testing accessibility becomes essential to pull off this integration.

## Benefits of Integrating Accessibility in the Agile Process

The biggest benefit is having compliant software. Turn around time on testing should decrease when it is focused on single tickets. Developers won't be forced to rewrite large sections of code after thinking the project is complete due to accessibility concerns. Because of the modular chunks being worked on, developers will begin to think about accessibility daily and consider it along with all the other normal factors to be considered during development. 

## Drawbacks

The biggest drawback is that developers are going to be unhappy starting out with this. Accessibility is treated as a dirty word amongst many devs and having it integrated into a daily process will cause some growing pains.
