				<p>I attended <a href="http://www.frostburg.edu">FSU</a> from 2005 to 2010 for both my B.S. and M.S. degrees. I graduated from FSU with a B.S. in Mathematics in 2008 and stayed on to get a M.S. in Computer Science in 2010.</p>

<p>I originally started at the University of MD, but transferred after a year and a half. The differences were immense. I went from the feeling of being “just a number” to getting an individualized education in a smaller school. I can’t praise Frostburg enough.</p>

<p>The math program at FSU was fantastic, I learned from a handful of great professors, my favorite being Dr. Hughes. I think I took six or eight classes from him by the time I graduated. I enjoyed Number Theory and Graph Theory the most. I think because the theories and techniques I learned were so readily applied to my programming.</p>

<p>On a whim, while studying for my math degree, I took a computer science class. I took an immediate liking to programming and decided to pursue it. Due to an odd quirk in my timing, it actually would take less time to graduate with a Master’s degree than to switch to a double major. I completed a minor in CS and then worked with the CS department to get a graduate assistantship so I could afford to get a Master’s degree.</p>

<p>Computer Science at Frostburg was an interesting and fun degree. Dr. Chitsaz was the most challenging professor I studied under in both his database and compiler courses. Professor Thiel, who taught digital logic and intro programming classes, and I have stayed in touch and regularly visit when I’m in town, still discussing topics in computer science and outside life.</p>

<p>As a graduate assistant, I developed skills in interpersonal communication as well as a deeper understanding of the course material. I ran the computer lab a few hours a week for lower level programming courses and the new Discrete Mathematics course. I worked with students in office hours and graded homework and projects. Grading taught me more about reading other people’s code and being adaptable in my solutions to problems.</p>

<p>I developed lasting friendships that have carried through to today with my fellow students in both programs at Frostburg. I even landed a job as a result of my contacts and the reputation of my peers.</p>

<p>I can’t recommend Frostburg’s Math and Computer Science programs enough. I learned a ton, felt well prepared for my career, and made lasting relationships with professors and peers.</p>
