&lt;p&gt;This post got out of hand as I started putting all my bitchiness to words. I didn’t start out to be so negative but the entire process is pretty negative and is still an open wound to pick at for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to unforeseen circumstances at my previous company, I started actively looking for work again a couple of months ago. After taking a few weeks off to try to organize myself and get my head straight, I started applying for jobs. After numerous interviews and a brief stint as a contractor I landed at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wisc.edu&quot;&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; supporting researchers at the &lt;a href=&quot;http:://www.glbrc.org&quot;&gt;Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. As a lead developer, it became my job to find some developers to fit our needs at the center. This switch has given me insight into how broken both sides of the interviewing system are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-interviewing-sucks-as-a-candidate&quot;&gt;Why Interviewing Sucks as a Candidate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying is a pain&lt;/strong&gt; - The number of companies which required me to upload a resume, then spend an hour filling out every piece of information from my resume in a 20 part web form is ridiculous. Repeating this process over and over again is defeating.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruiters&lt;/strong&gt; - Putting your information out there on Dice / Monster / LinkedIn / whatever other sites you feel appropriate is awful. I get daily calls asking me if I’d be interested in moving across the country to work on a three month contract working in wordpress for $12 an hour. I get email after email of recruiters that have obviously never read my resume sending me jobs I have no interest in or am nowhere nearly qualified for. Do yourself a favor and create a google voice number and new email for the job hunt that you can abandon afterwards. You can share your normal contact information with anyone you feel is worth keeping in contact with, I’m sure they won’t be offended as they’ve probably experienced the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting through HR is hard.&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ve seen job descriptions requiring 6 years of HTML 5 experience (released late 2014). I’ve gotten math quiz questions that were unsolvable. I can’t count the number of times somebody thought Java and JavaScript were the same thing. It all boils down to non-technical people given a list of attributes being looked for and not having the common experience or even language to have the flexibility needed to filter good candidates from bad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t stop them from filtering. It reminds me of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jasonbock.net/jb/News/Item/7c334037d1a9437d9fa6506e2f35eaac&quot;&gt;classic post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having the specific combination of experience expected is often impossible&lt;/strong&gt; - The requirements for many positions posted are ridiculous and should be regarded more as a wishlist than requirements, but the people involved are often choosing beggars looking for someone who is an expert at all flavors of JavaScript while also being an expert in System Ops and Ruby / Python / etc. I’ve had people suggest that I couldn’t learn .net because I was a Ruby programmer. The truth is that the ability to learn new things and adapt to whatever is required is infinitely superior, but much harder to grasp from a resume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing is time consuming&lt;/strong&gt; - At this point, most companies I interviewed with had a multi-stepped interview barrage that seemed to be designed to eat up all of your time and happiness to browbeat you into giving up your search. Starting with a time consuming web application, fighting your way through HR and ignoring the impossible requirement posted, you land a phone interview with an HR person. Then another phone interview with a developer. Then a video call. Then an in person interview or two.
Add in a couple coding exercises, in languages you’ve never used and with a time limit on when they’re due. The time limit doesn’t take into account your time spent watching the baby, dealing with a death in the family, other interviews, or any other number of more important things in your life than dropping a days worth of work on the hopes of it leading to a job interview and that the position is actually something you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The in-person interviews range from a couple of hours to an entire day. There are a flurry of people in and out while you sit there answering the same questions and contemplating how long it will be until you can take a break and use the restroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing is intimidating&lt;/strong&gt; - Having a group of strangers sit in a last supper format staring you down while pounding you with questions feels like you’re the subject of a Congressional Investigation. Add in the fact that you’ve worked a remote job for the last four years without talking to anybody in a professional setting like this and it’s unsettling. There is also the inherent need to land a job piling extra pressure on you to perform. As I’m sure many feel, socialization and public speaking aren’t the most natural skills for developers and the interview process is daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s hard to compete&lt;/strong&gt; - There is stiff competition out there for many positions, especially nationally posted remote positions. You’re competing with people from around the country for the chance to work remote. Those impossible requirements mentioned above? They had five people that blew those out of the water interview before you so good luck selling yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s hard to get what you’re worth&lt;/strong&gt; - Companies use any weakness they can find as an excuse to lowball you on an offer. Sometimes it’s hard to stand up for yourself and demand what you’re worth when you’re stressed about finding work and defeated by the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing costs money&lt;/strong&gt; - When unemployed, you start thinking about where every dollar is going and things like gas, parking, and dress clothes start to add up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewers want to hire themselves&lt;/strong&gt; - People tend to judge people more similar to them less harshly. Whether it’s race, sex, or background, people are more likely to hire someone that they see a reflection of themselves in. This isn’t always the case, but is prevalant and may mean the effort put in is for nothing if the wrong person wants to hire someone of the same race.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This can be taken advantage of if you can find someone from the same town, same college, same former company, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coding tests are BS&lt;/strong&gt; - Remembering how to balance a binary tree doesn’t make you a good hire and forgetting doesn’t make you a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Coding on a whiteboard or even just without using google and stack overflow is unrealistic to what daily jobs look like for most developers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Take home coding tests are time consuming and exploitable. Many are expected in the language / tools of the new position, which may be a foreign language to you. Most are delivered via github, thus exposing every applicant’s entry to each other. It’s usually rushed and finished with a lack of enthusiasm in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The best coding tests I had were on the spot, given a computer with common tools and told to go as far as I could in a half hour. It’s respectful of time and a realistic examination of how someone works.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing is a skill that gets worse without practice&lt;/strong&gt; - If you haven’t interviewed in years, it’s hard to interview. It’s a skill that like most, without practice will wither away. Combine this with the fact that if you’ve been employed, you probably haven’t interviewed in a while and your odds go down without putting in leg work to practice interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s hard to sell yourself&lt;/strong&gt; - Nearly every good developer I know fights impostor syndrome constantly. Whether it is in a small office or on a global scale, it’s hard not to see the incredible things other people are doing and compare to the misplaced semicolon you spent a day debugging. It’s easy to see accomplishments in others and harder in yourself, and the reverse is true of shortcomings. This results in making selling yourself feeling like a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may just not connect&lt;/strong&gt; - I had an interview where the company liked my resume and experience, liked me, but said I “wasn’t enthusiastic about working for them.” This was a misread on their part, as at the time it was a job I had talked about with my family and friends about how I hoped to land it. Sometimes the interviewer just misreads the candidate or the candidate doesn’t convey their skills or attitude well enough and it results in a missed connection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being ghosted is awful&lt;/strong&gt; - Interviewing at a place, completing coding tests, investing gas and parking money and time to jump through all the hoops, only to be left without any contact at all is too common. It’s killer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes it all comes down to luck&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s been suggested that researchers rate later candidates lower than ones interviewed earlier in the day. People judge harshly when hungry, thirsty, or needing a bathroom break. Maybe the interview you scheduled a week ago coincided with a production issue popping up that pulled the guy out of the room you had the best chance of connecting with and turning to your side. There is a lot of random luck in making a good impression and being competitive for a position.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In general it is pointless&lt;/strong&gt; - Many interviewers lack the ability to make the best decision for who to hire. Interviewing skills and the skills needed during the course of work are often vastly different and success at one isn’t strongly correlated to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-why-interviewing-sucks-as-a-candidate&quot;&gt;Summary of Why Interviewing Sucks as a Candidate:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing is time consuming, depressing, and largely fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-interviewing-sucks-as-an-interviewer&quot;&gt;Why Interviewing Sucks as an Interviewer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding candidates is a pain&lt;/strong&gt; - Posting a job requires work to match the job description to the actual skills being hunted. You have to consider where you’re posting it and how to promote it to catch the eye of the perfect candidate. Being too descriptive leads to people not applying, but being to vague is also a turn-off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most candidates aren’t good&lt;/strong&gt; - Half of all people are below average, and most of the good ones already have jobs. Your selection pool is bound to draw a plethora of bad candidates for every good candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your HR department doesn’t know what makes a good candidate&lt;/strong&gt; - It’s like a bad game of telephone: you say you want someone with 5 years of experience and that has used VueJS and it somehow comes out that someone is required to have 5 years of VueJS experience (out for 3 years now). You and your candidate may speak a common language, but the HR department may not be on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements are vague&lt;/strong&gt; - On the flip side, trying to hire for a position you don’t know much about is a common task, and doing your best is all you can do. But, like with many things when it comes to programming, requirements are vague and what is wanted and what is described are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding experienced candidates is near impossible&lt;/strong&gt; - Outside of some of the more common languages like Java, finding something like an experienced Ruby on Rails developer that can hit the ground running and contribute within a short period of time can be a daunting task.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing is time consuming&lt;/strong&gt; - Honestly reading resumes is very time consuming, as is contacting candidates, organizing interview schedules, doing phone screenings, writing interview questions, designing process around interviews, actually interviewing. Add in extra time for trying to advertise the position, recruit at meetups or contacting your network to find people. Throw in reviewing code submitted in a language you’ve never used for a coding test written a few years ago. You’re now in the time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Candidates blend together&lt;/strong&gt; - When you read 40 resumes, you get tired. The ones at the top get a fairer shake due to fatigue, hunger, or whatever other distractions are going on. Same thing for interviews. Doing phone screenings, video calls, or actual interviews with multiple people leads to most of them seeming the same. It’s a hopeless feeling to have a dozen resumes on the table without a good way to tell them apart and having to roll the dice and be stuck with your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget and other issues may limit what you can offer&lt;/strong&gt; - Maybe your company doesn’t have the budget for the salary someone wants. Maybe you can’t offer the time off they need. Maybe your benefits aren’t as good as another company’s. If all goes well, you’re going to be competing for the top candidate with other companies and sometimes you fall short when making an offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing is a production killer&lt;/strong&gt; - You want your best people doing the interviewing. Talent is attracted to talent, and not only do the better people have a better eye for talent, they’re the better representatives of your company when you’re trying to recruit. Taking an hour of production from your best people is a huge sink. Taking an entire afternoon or morning (or day) is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saying no feels bad&lt;/strong&gt; - A majority of candidates you interview would have their life significantly improved by taking the job you offer, so saying no to someone that’s already down on their luck is tough. Doing what’s right for you and your company is selfish but it’s survival of the fittest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The alternative may be that super nice guy you can’t get rid of that never accomplishes anything.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes luck to find the right candidate&lt;/strong&gt; - The candidate pool is constantly in motion, churning out people and having others poured in. It may be that the perfect candidate just accepted another offer, or that at the moment they’re not looking. Odds are the perfect candidate exists and is already employed somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People suck at interviewing&lt;/strong&gt; - Especially tech people. Being able to sell yourself doesn’t make you a good programmer, and you may pass on someone that didn’t interview well that would have been a great asset to your team.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary-of-why-interviewing-sucks-as-an-interviewer&quot;&gt;Summary of Why Interviewing Sucks as an Interviewer:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interviewing is time consuming, depressing, and largely fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-good-about-interviews&quot;&gt;So What is Good About Interviews?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting People&lt;/strong&gt; - Interviewing as an interviewer or as a candidate is a great way to meet interesting people with similar interests and in similar fields to your own. I’ve hit it off with multiple interviewers, even when the job didn’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviewing gets easier the more you do it&lt;/strong&gt; - Sure it’s always depressing and a time sink, but as you practice more, it’s slightly more cheerful and slightly less time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You might get lucky&lt;/strong&gt; - With persistance, you can find good jobs and good candidates. It pays off in the long run, but can be a brutal process whilst in the midst of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s better than not interviewing&lt;/strong&gt; - The reason we interview is that we have to do something. You need a job or you need an asset. Focus on the end goal and not on the process of the first step on that path.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-be-improved&quot;&gt;What Can be Improved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure better minds than mine have tried for the history of employment to find better ways to hire people. The best thing to do is learn from your mistakes and the mistakes of others and do your best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got some kind of mind blowing techniques, send them to me, I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure who created the game, but a few years ago I was invited to play in a fantasy league during the NFL playoffs which had an interesting premise. It combined fantasy football, which normally ends in week 16 of the regular season, with a survivor pool. Each participant picks one quarterback, one running back, and one wide receiver each week of the playoffs. The participant is not allowed to pick the same player twice. Standard fantasy rules apply and a winner is calculated from total points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allure of the game is that it allows one to continue playing fantasy football without entering into the fanduel type format. There are some interesting strategies as some participants will try to conserve players they think will make the super bowl, some participants will pick from only one conference until the super bowl, guaranteeing them starting players from the other conference, and some participants simply pick whoever they think will gain the most points. It’s always interesting when somebody has a lot of points but no starting quarterback in the super bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-logistics-and-tech-behind-the-game&quot;&gt;The Logistics and Tech Behind the Game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the years I’ve run my own league, I have had participants email me their choices each week and I’ve manually calculated their scores using an excel spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, I am planning to create a quick rails app which will allow for each player to make their picks and shows them who they have already picked. Scoring is a bit trickier, I may write some code to scrape data from a source to get reliable statistics with regular updates, or I may manually enter stats after the games are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have new ideas for fantasy style games, please feel free to reach out and talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-game&quot;&gt;The Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, we set out upon looking for ways to choose our draft order for fantasy football and I stumbled on an article about an alternative betting pool that didn’t require much prior knowledge to win. I think the original source of the method is Bill James, as linked &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/ncaa-bracket-math-1043/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but it’s behind a paywall now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the game is that every participant picks one team from each seed. That is one 1 seed, one 2 seed, one 3 seed, etc. Each win that team earns earns the participant points. Points are based on seed, starting with 100 points for a 1 seed, 110 for a 2 seed, all the way down to 250 for a 16 seed win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first year doing it, we each threw in $10 and also used it to pick our fantasy football draft order to huge success. The biggest worry was that we would have ties and have to settle the draft order some other way, but with fourteen participants, we had no ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first year of success, we continued the following year without the involvement of the fantasy football league. Again, we had fourteen participants, and this time we had one tie for seventh place. In both of the first years it came down to the final game for the win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, with half the elite eight games complete, I think the winner has been determined. I haven’t run all the numbers, but from a cursory glance it would seem the leader is uncatchable with the lineups of the other participants. Personally, I would have finished last if it weren’t for my Dad performing even worse than I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we expanded to have 19 teams competing. We ended up having two ties deep in the field, but none in the places for money. One would have been broken with total win count. A pick for final score in the final might also help too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to invite more people, but I fear that if too many people join there will be more issues of ties in the game. This may end being an interesting statistical problem to determine maximum number of participants without the likelihood of a tie for the top few spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are 2^32 sets of teams possible to choose, many of the choices end up being equivalent from a score perspective. For instance, this year, no 13, 14, 15, or 16 seed won a game. With all the ties at different seed levels there were essentially 82,944 unique scores of the original 4,294,967,296 lineups (as of 3/25 with 5 games left). This isn’t eliminating ways you can tie with different lineups, just eliminates differences when multiple teams of the same seed scored the same number of wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-logistics-and-tech-behind-the-game&quot;&gt;The Logistics and Tech Behind the Game&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first year I had participants email me their choices for each seed and I made a complicated spreadsheet to keep track of all the scoring. Being lazy last year led me to reuse the same sheet. Everybody could view it on google spreadsheets and check the scores and I updated it daily with the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I built a quick rails app on Selection Sunday with a simple form to select each seed and threw it up on digital ocean. With the exception of some problems from a few technologically hindered people, the form and app worked without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some analysis, I added pages which calculate the optimal lineup possible and which show how many people selected each team and how teams of each seed compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While simple, the app does a lot of calculations on the fly that I may run as a one time calculation on scoring updates and serve as static data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also like to make a better interface for selecting teams, maybe something that highlights all the paths through the bracket there are for teams participants already selected so they don’t end up picking teams that face each other in the first couple rounds. That would require a bit more logic in terms of the bracket structure. Currently there are team records with seeds, a boolean to show if they’re eliminated, and win count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other improvement would be an admin interface. I logged into the server and used the console to update each team’s records with win counts and elimination status this year. The alternative to this would be some sort of scraper which automatically updated scores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping to open source the code and share it around to some other sports fans to see if anybody else likes the format for next year. This might also lead to some interesting pull requests to add features to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also planning to write an app for the fantasy football three-for-all this year, where we use standard fantasy scoring and pick one wide receiver, one running back, and one quarterback each week during the playoffs without being able to use any player more than once. We’ve run this before with some interesting results, but never had an app to calculate scores.&lt;/p&gt;

I miss the expandable memory and storage of the older models though. I’m not sold on the new version of the Macbook Pro. I don’t think I could go back to Windows full-time at this point though, although I do keep threatening to switch to a linux environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-highlights.html&quot;&gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - iTerm2 version 3 has many features that are of great use while programming. Features I use regularly include split panes (cmd-d and cmd-shift-d), cmd-click filenames to edit that file, and the paste history. There are more features than I can remember, and the app increases productivity almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zsh.org/&quot;&gt;Zsh&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&quot;&gt;Oh-my-zsh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Zsh improves upon bash in every way. Text completion is awesome. Path expansion improves navigation immeasurably. The improved command history functionality is also a huge time saver. Oh-my-zsh supports numerous plugins and themes for zsh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Git is an easy to learn version control system for tracking changes in files worked on by multiple people. It was created by Linus for developing Linux. It is distributed so every git directory is a full-fledged repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Github has revolutionized the programming world. Nearly every major open source project is hosted on github.com. It has driven the adoption of git as the VCS to use. The feature set is copied on other sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bitbucket.org&quot;&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s nothing quite as good as the original. It’s free to use as long as your project is open to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gist.github.com&quot;&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Github’s little brother, a great site developed by the Github team to share snippets of code with full syntax highlighting and easy to use interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Ruby is my current programming language of choice, with Rails being the default framework for web development in Ruby. It’s quick to get an app up and running and has matured to the point of having widespread support for whatever issues you run into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getbootstrap.com&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Bootstrap is the most popular web framework for building responsive projects. There are a variety of css themes but for prototyping using the default css is quick and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Atom is a highly extensible IDE released by the team at Github. It works as well as anything I’ve used and requires less learning than vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getpostman.com&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Postman is a great tool for developing APIs. You can import and export saved API documentation and examples. The only feature I wish it had was the ability to sync with a git repo to share requests amongst a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrome.google.com&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Google’s browser has a wide variety of plugins and a solid set of developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - Stack Overflow has allowed people to find answers to questions they seek (about programming). Gone are the days of searching through forums for somebody with similar issues to yours. If you google an issue with a modern programming language, chances are the first dozen results are Stack Overflow questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spotify.com&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - While not related to programming, Spotify does provide music, which helps keep me from getting distracted by outside influences. Spotify is a great service and a great interface. The library is huge and ad-free service is worth the price of the subscription if used on a regular basis. The daily mixes are getting better and better to my taste and I’ve actually discovered numerous bands I like from the “Discover Weekly” playlist they generate.&lt;/p&gt;

My AcuRite is a site dedicated to home environmental monitoring using devices manufactured by Chaney Electronics under the AcuRite brand. Sensor types include temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rainfall, lightning proximity, light intensity, and water detection. The site offers monitoring that will notify users when sensors go out of range, useful for things like detecting freezing around pipes or the presence of water in a basement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Smart Hubs” are paired with each sensor and connected to the internet to send data to the servers. These hubs send sensor data to our servers a few times per minute. This presents an interesting challenge in scalability as we are processing approximately four hundred thousand requests per hour. Micro-services handle the load by scaling independently to process data, relying on queueing systems to keep everything cohesive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the existing framework built for OneVue was applicable for My AcuRite. Most of the work done has been optimization and support for more custom endpoints to limit data transmission on mobile devices. We created a second bastion API which allows access to some of the same micro-services behind OneVue. We also now support native apps on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other challenge in building the site was the migration of data from the old site. We worked with the old contractors to spec out an API to access customer data, then built a webpage that allowed users to enter username and password and import the data to the new site. This also triggered a flag to update the firmware of their devices to point at the new service. Once the firmware was updated, it started reporting data and would be automatically claimed by the “new” user in our system. We tested the system by sending invites to a few thousand users as beta testers and monitored the performance of our system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kevin compiled one of the best teams I have ever been a part of. We started with a team of one DevOps administrator, one Architect, three members of the “service team” to work on the back-end API, and two members of the “UI team” to build the JS website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.primexonevue.com&quot;&gt;OneVue&lt;/a&gt; is a system for both environmental monitoring and time solutions for B2B consumers mostly consisting of schools and health systems. For schools, there are clocks that set themselves based on an NTP server as well as update statuses of connection and battery level through the web interface. For hospitals, there are a variety of sensors to measure environmental factors like temperature and humidity. When a measurement goes out of range, we send notification emails, phone calls, and text messages to a list of users. We also keep detailed logs for compliance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started working on replacing the existing systems for Primex OneVue. We built from the ground up starting with some micro-services built in Ruby on Rails. Our rails apps deliver JSON exclusively. Between the front-end and the micro-services we have a bastion API. We have a separate ReactJS front-end that consumes the APIs through the bastion API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OneVue system utilizes an impressive array of cloud technologies. We use EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, Cloudfront, Route 53, Cloudwatch, API Gateway, Kinesis, and SQS. We’ve worked with MySQL, Postgres, Redis, and DynamoDB with different parts of our application. We use Rails, Python, and JS for our programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on this app was interesting as my first experience writing a pure API. Focusing on scalability and efficiency in processing the readings coming from our sensors is also an interesting proposition, as well as reliability for the customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CTAC was a shock to the system after Epic. The team dynamic was a lot smaller and seemed closer knit. I became good friends with most of my coworkers and started learning how to write dynamic web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://syndication.hhs.gov&quot;&gt;Syndication Project&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed government agencies (and outside agencies) to publish articles to their websites while sharing them with other websites. There was a system of feeds you could subscribe to and automatically publish articles on multiple locations at once, as well as updating and removing content. This application was written in Groovy with Grails. It was an interesting language to work with, although I found the support for Ruby and Rails to be much better at the time. When we couldn’t figure out how to do something we tended to fall back on java and so our project was a strange mix in the early days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After working on Syndication, I moved to the Rails team and started learning Ruby on Rails. I worked on numerous projects with Rails, including ICRAS (the now defunct paperworkreduction.gov), DARMIS, and some internal projects for HHS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed my time at CTAC immensely. I felt like I was learning the entire time I was employed there. I never felt comfortable living in the DC Metro Area, and wanted to return to Madison though. CTAC was gracious enough to allow me to work remotely for a while until I found a new position at Primex in WI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I can say about getting out of government contracting is there are a lot less meetings now than when I was there. With so many eyes on the projects and so many people with vested interest, it was hard to just get work done and make something useful.&lt;/p&gt;

After a short time of looking online at different positions and realizing there was not much to choose from in Western MD and the surrounding areas, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epic.com&quot;&gt;Epic&lt;/a&gt; in Verona, WI contacted me regarding my resume posted online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never thought of Wisconsin as a place I would ever want to visit, let alone live, but decided to go check out both the area and the company. As soon as I got to Madison I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once through the interview process, I packed up my belongings and some furniture collected from yard sales and moved to Madison. I started as a programmer in September of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started at Epic, I was one of a couple hundred hired around that time. We studied a variety of topics like version control and internal processes for code review. I learned the importance of coding standards when working in a large organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was assigned to the Kaleidoscope team which worked on the product for Ophthalmologists. This was an interesting product and I was happy to be a part of it. This was my first real experience working on a small team. (It also improved my spelling as I had never had to write out kaleidoscope or ophthalmology before.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while, I felt like the learning stopped and I was trapped using the dated technology their system was built on. I was afraid at the time I’d get pigeon-holed into working with the same technology for a prolonged period. My college friend Steffen contacted me with an offer of a job at CTAC and took it, although I missed Madison a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the experience at Epic was a good one. Most of my friends in Madison either work there or used to. I learned a lot and enjoyed living on my own in a strange city for the first time. I think if I were to go back I would enjoy it more and have more success with the maturity I’ve developed over the last several years.&lt;/p&gt;

I graduated from FSU with a B.S. in Mathematics in 2008 and stayed on to get a M.S. in Computer Science in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally started at the University of MD, but transferred after a year and a half. The differences were immense. I went from the feeling of being “just a number” to getting an individualized education in a smaller school. I can’t praise Frostburg enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The math program at FSU was fantastic, I learned from a handful of great professors, my favorite being Dr. Hughes. I think I took six or eight classes from him by the time I graduated. I enjoyed Number Theory and Graph Theory the most. I think because the theories and techniques I learned were so readily applied to my programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a whim, while studying for my math degree, I took a computer science class. I took an immediate liking to programming and decided to pursue it. Due to an odd quirk in my timing, it actually would take less time to graduate with a Master’s degree than to switch to a double major. I completed a minor in CS and then worked with the CS department to get a graduate assistantship so I could afford to get a Master’s degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer Science at Frostburg was an interesting and fun degree. Dr. Chitsaz was the most challenging professor I studied under in both his database and compiler courses. Professor Thiel, who taught digital logic and intro programming classes, and I have stayed in touch and regularly visit when I’m in town, still discussing topics in computer science and outside life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate assistant, I developed skills in interpersonal communication as well as a deeper understanding of the course material. I ran the computer lab a few hours a week for lower level programming courses and the new Discrete Mathematics course. I worked with students in office hours and graded homework and projects. Grading taught me more about reading other people’s code and being adaptable in my solutions to problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I developed lasting friendships that have carried through to today with my fellow students in both programs at Frostburg. I even landed a job as a result of my contacts and the reputation of my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t recommend Frostburg’s Math and Computer Science programs enough. I learned a ton, felt well prepared for my career, and made lasting relationships with professors and peers.&lt;/p&gt;
